<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About MagicCFG Reloaded

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

NEW FEATURES:
* Factory Reset Devices by one click
* Updated exploit (gaster) for 99% success rate (Thanks 0x7ff for that awesome rewrite of ipwndfu :)
* Support for M1/M2 mac
* Updated devices compability (find the eastereggs :)
* Improved purple mode...

The app makes it possible to read, write and restore important configuration data on iDevices, making it an important tool for hobbyists and professional repair stores. It requires no accessories except for a DCSD cable / adapter and is therefore much cheaper and faster to use than with conventional NAND programmers from the Far East.

Please note that the source code doesn't include any files to boot into diags mode... You may need to add it yourself...

This tool is mostly written in Swift and interacts with the syscfg partition of iDevices. So be careful in usage and make sure you understand what you are doing!

Features:
* Editing the device's sysCFG with ease, no need to solder and buy expensive programmers from China :)
* Identify issues of your device in combination with [MagicCFG Diagnostics]()
* Do NAND swaps easier
* Other fun stuff...
